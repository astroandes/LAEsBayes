Referee Report 
Reviewer's Comments:



1. "When looking at figure 3, it is clear that the allowed range of
parameters is not wide enough to sample the full probability
distribution. Therefore, the mean and scatter of the parameters
obtained from the one-dimensional probabilities could be biased.  
To improve this the authors need to increase the range of allowed
parameters. This can have a strong impact on their conclusions, for
example the one with respect to the width of the mass range of LAE
hosts." 

The point raised by the referee  confirms the main thesis of our
paper. Namely, the high impact that cosmic variance can have on
constraining the paremeters of our model. 

Examining Figure 3. one clearly sees that the histogram for M_min does
not significantly decreases for lower masses. 
This might be a hint that lower values of M_min are consistent with
observations.  
M_min in turn constrains f_occ (also seen in Figure 3), while the
upper limit in M_max is driven by the physics of dark matter
clustering, i.e., there is an upper limit for halo masses in a fixed
cosmological volume.

The referee's request to increase the range of allowed parameters can
thus only be realized by going to lower values of M_min. 
We did not go to lower values of this parameter for two reasons. 

First, our lower limit of 10^9.7 Msun/h is at least 0.3dex below than all the
lower bound expectations from previous observational studies;
Bielby+2016 had a lower bound of 10^10.4 Msun/h, Gawiser+2007 had 10^10
Msun/h and Ouchi+2010 favors a lower limit of 10^{10} Msun/h.

Second, stating from that observational evidence we chose a 
publicly available cosmological simulation that a) had cosmological
parameters consistent with Planck observations, b) could provide a
realiable mass function below 10^{10} Msun/h and c) had total volume that
would allow us to build statistics with at least 10 independent
volumes. 
The only simulation with those characteristics is Bolshoi.
Performing the test suggested by the referee in a robust way is not
possible given this limitation for an appropriate cosmological
simulation. 

Given the importance of this point raised by the referee (which
strenghtens our case to explicitly take into account cosmic variance), 
we have included in the paper a summary of the reasons behind the
limitations in the parameters we use (Section 2.2).
We also mention explicitly this potential bias in the new Section 3.3
and sugggest in the conclusions as a next interesting step to
extend our results is the use of cosmological simulations with higher
resolution. 
 
We agree with the referee that it would be interesting to push to much
lower masses the values of m_min, and quote this in the conclusions as
an interesting way to extend our results. 





2. "The choice of the occupation fraction focc as a fixed fraction for
a given halo to be occupied by an LAE means the mass function of
haloes is being scaled down (in most cases) by this factor. In this
sense, it is to be expected that as the minimum halo mass  allowed is
increased, this fraction will also increase in order to maintain a
fixed number of LAEs per field (more massive haloes  are less
abundant). This should be mentioned in the text."

This is now mention at the end of Section 3.1.

- Also because of the fixed focc, the median halo mass and halo mass width could actually be calculated analytically, except that 
the authors are interested in cosmic variance, which they obtain from different subvolumes in the simulation. Is this the reason 
for the large scatter seen in figure 4?

JAIME PLEASE ELABORATE A BIT MORE:
      	     	       	    EACH POINT IN FIGURE 4 REFERS TO A SINGLE MODEL GIVEN BY  Mmin-Mmax. ADDITIONALLY, DUE TO THE STEPPEN 
			    ASSYMETRY OF THE MASS FUNCTION FOR A GIVEN  MMIN, M50 IS ALMOST FIXED (WITHIN ~0.2 DEX) AND BASICALLY 
			    THE VERTICAL SPREAD IN FIGURE 4 IS DUE TO DIFFERENT VALUES OF MMAX GIVEN MMIN. THE COMPUTED VALUES OF
			    OF M50 AND DELTAM  TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE EFFECT OF COSMIC VARIANCE, BECAUSE THEY ARE THE MEDIAN VALUES 
			    OVER THE 27FIELD, AND THE POISONIAN ERROR GIVEN THE LIMITED NUMBER OF OBJECTS IN EACH FIELD. 
			    THESE TWO EFFECTSCANNOT BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT BY A SIMPLE ANALYTICAL PRESCRIPTION.




- In their chi2 analysis the authors are ignoring covariances. The authors could comment on this choice (perhaps covariances are 
not expected to be strong at these angular separations?)


JULIAN!!!!. 


Minor comments:

- Is the increase of the clustering amplitude with Delta(logM) expected from the steeper increase of the bias factor for larger 
halo masses?

ANSWER: This is what we think but is not conclusive because the cosmic variance  still dominates make all the models conssistent. 


- The width of the distribution of Figure 5 is measured with 27 mock fields, but this does not really mean that a comparison to 
observations requires 27 observed fields.

ANSWER: WE AGREE WITH THIS COMMENT. WHAT WE ACTUALLY WANTED TO SAY WAS THAT TO BE ABLE MEASURE THIS WIDTH APPOPIATELY WE NEED OF A 
NUMBER OF FIELD OF THE ORDER OR LARGER THAN 27. 



- Please add units to the grey scales used in Figure 3, and y-axes labels to the one dimensional probability distributions.

ANSWER: JAIME PLEASE, BE POLITE HERE. THE CONTOURS AND PROYECTIONS ALREADY GIVE AN IDEA OF THE DISTRIBUTIONS. ADDING THESE NUMBERS
IS QUITE COMPLCATED AND WONT CONTRIBUTE MUCH TO THE DISCUSSION. 


- In the introduction it is stated that previous works do not elaborate on cosmic variance, but in general they do, to some degree
 (for instance, Guaita et al., 2010).
SAY SOME SOMETHING LIKE PREVIOS ATTEMPS TRIED TO INCLUDE THE EFFECT OF COSMIC VARIANCE FOLLOWING SOMMERVILLE 2004 BUT DIRECTLY FROM A 
DARK MATTER SIMULATION AND ACCOUNTING AT THE SAME TIME FOR THE OBSERVATIONAL BIASES.


- S2.1: is this equivalent width limit in rest-frame?




- Last paragraph 2.3: rephrase first sentence "we note by the paper M"
