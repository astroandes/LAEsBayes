Referee Report 
Reviewer's Comments:
The manuscript "Uncertainty on the Galaxy-halo Connection for Lyman-alpha Emitters at z=3.1" by Mejia-Restrepo and Forero-Romero,
 presents a new method to understand the clustering of z=3.1 Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs) using mock catalogues constructed from 
simulations using a simple occupation model of haloes by LAEs. This is a novel approach in itself, more complete with respect to 
what is usually applied to LAE clustering analysis. It is interesting the wide range of masses that are able to reproduce the 
observed clustering, but I wonder how much these conclusions are affected by the priors adopted here.

I find the idea very interesting, but have a few concerns which I point out next.






- When looking at figure 3, it is clear that the allowed range of parameters is not wide enough to sample the full probability 
distribution. Therefore, the mean and scatter of the parameters obtained from the one-dimensional probabilities could be biased. 
To improve this the authors need to increase the range of allowed parameters. This can have a strong impact on their conclusions, 
for example the one with respect to the width of the mass range of LAE hosts.

JAIME PLEASE HELP ME ELABORATING A BIT MORE:

    WE SHOULD MAKE  MORE EXPLICIT  IN THE PAPER THAT OUR MINIMUM MASS IS LIMITED BY THE RESOLUTION LIMITATIONS OF THE SIMULATION.
BELOW SUCH THRESHOLD (	 \logM$=$9.8) THE MASS FUNCTION IS NOT WELL BEHAVED (IN THE SENSE THAT IT START TO DECREASE AS logM DECREASES).
NOT INC



- The choice of the occupation fraction focc as a fixed fraction for a given halo to be occupied by an LAE means the mass function
 of haloes is being scaled down (in most cases) by this factor. In this sense, it is to be expected that as the minimum halo mass 
allowed is increased, this fraction will also increase in order to maintain a fixed number of LAEs per field (more massive haloes 
are less abundant). This should be mentioned in the text.

THE NUMBER DENSITY OF LAEs IS FIXED AND CONSEQUENTLY THE OCCUPATON FRACTION IS ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY (HOWEVER IT CHANGES 
WITHIN A FACTOR ~3 FROM FIELD TO FIELD AS A CONSEQUENCES OF COSMIC VARIANCE)




- Also because of the fixed focc, the median halo mass and halo mass width could actually be calculated analytically, except that 
the authors are interested in cosmic variance, which they obtain from different subvolumes in the simulation. Is this the reason 
for the large scatter seen in figure 4?

JAIME PLEASE ELABORATE A BIT MORE:
      	     	       	    EACH POINT IN FIGURE 4 REFERS TO A SINGLE MODEL GIVEN BY  Mmin-Mmax. ADDITIONALLY, DUE TO THE STEPPEN 
			    ASSYMETRY OF THE MASS FUNCTION FOR A GIVEN  MMIN, M50 IS ALMOST FIXED (WITHIN ~0.2 DEX) AND BASICALLY 
			    THE VERTICAL SPREAD IN FIGURE 4 IS DUE TO DIFFERENT VALUES OF MMAX GIVEN MMIN. THE COMPUTED VALUES OF
			    OF M50 AND DELTAM  TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE EFFECT OF COSMIC VARIANCE, BECAUSE THEY ARE THE MEDIAN VALUES 
			    OVER THE 27FIELD, AND THE POISONIAN ERROR GIVEN THE LIMITED NUMBER OF OBJECTS IN EACH FIELD. 
			    THESE TWO EFFECTSCANNOT BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT BY A SIMPLE ANALYTICAL PRESCRIPTION.




- In their chi2 analysis the authors are ignoring covariances. The authors could comment on this choice (perhaps covariances are 
not expected to be strong at these angular separations?)


JULIAN!!!!. 


Minor comments:

- Is the increase of the clustering amplitude with Delta(logM) expected from the steeper increase of the bias factor for larger 
halo masses?

ANSWER: This is what we think but is not conclusive because the cosmic variance  still dominates make all the models conssistent. 


- The width of the distribution of Figure 5 is measured with 27 mock fields, but this does not really mean that a comparison to 
observations requires 27 observed fields.

ANSWER: WE AGREE WITH THIS COMMENT. WHAT WE ACTUALLY WANTED TO SAY WAS THAT TO BE ABLE MEASURE THIS WIDTH APPOPIATELY WE NEED OF A 
NUMBER OF FIELD OF THE ORDER OR LARGER THAN 27. 



- Please add units to the grey scales used in Figure 3, and y-axes labels to the one dimensional probability distributions.

ANSWER: JAIME PLEASE, BE POLITE HERE. THE CONTOURS AND PROYECTIONS ALREADY GIVE AN IDEA OF THE DISTRIBUTIONS. ADDING THESE NUMBERS
IS QUITE COMPLCATED AND WONT CONTRIBUTE MUCH TO THE DISCUSSION. 


- In the introduction it is stated that previous works do not elaborate on cosmic variance, but in general they do, to some degree
 (for instance, Guaita et al., 2010).
SAY SOME SOMETHING LIKE PREVIOS ATTEMPS TRIED TO INCLUDE THE EFFECT OF COSMIC VARIANCE FOLLOWING SOMMERVILLE 2004 BUT DIRECTLY FROM A 
DARK MATTER SIMULATION AND ACCOUNTING AT THE SAME TIME FOR THE OBSERVATIONAL BIASES.


- S2.1: is this equivalent width limit in rest-frame?




- Last paragraph 2.3: rephrase first sentence "we note by the paper M"
