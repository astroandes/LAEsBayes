Referee Report 
Reviewer's Comments:
The manuscript "Uncertainty on the Galaxy-halo Connection for Lyman-alpha Emitters at z=3.1" by Mejia-Restrepo and Forero-Romero,
 presents a new method to understand the clustering of z=3.1 Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs) using mock catalogues constructed from 
simulations using a simple occupation model of haloes by LAEs. This is a novel approach in itself, more complete with respect to 
what is usually applied to LAE clustering analysis. It is interesting the wide range of masses that are able to reproduce the 
observed clustering, but I wonder how much these conclusions are affected by the priors adopted here.

I find the idea very interesting, but have a few concerns which I point out next.

- When looking at figure 3, it is clear that the allowed range of parameters is not wide enough to sample the full probability 
distribution. Therefore, the mean and scatter of the parameters obtained from the one-dimensional probabilities could be biased. 
To improve this the authors need to increase the range of allowed parameters. This can have a strong impact on their conclusions, 
for example the one with respect to the width of the mass range of LAE hosts.

- The choice of the occupation fraction focc as a fixed fraction for a given halo to be occupied by an LAE means the mass function
 of haloes is being scaled down (in most cases) by this factor. In this sense, it is to be expected that as the minimum halo mass 
allowed is increased, this fraction will also increase in order to maintain a fixed number of LAEs per field (more massive haloes 
are less abundant). This should be mentioned in the text.

- Also because of the fixed focc, the median halo mass and halo mass width could actually be calculated analytically, except that 
the authors are interested in cosmic variance, which they obtain from different subvolumes in the simulation. Is this the reason 
for the large scatter seen in figure 4?

- In their chi2 analysis the authors are ignoring covariances. The authors could comment on this choice (perhaps covariances are 
not expected to be strong at these angular separations?)

Minor comments:

- Is the increase of the clustering amplitude with Delta(logM) expected from the steeper increase of the bias factor for larger 
halo masses?

- The width of the distribution of Figure 5 is measured with 27 mock fields, but this does not really mean that a comparison to 
observations requires 27 observed fields.

- Please add units to the grey scales used in Figure 3, and y-axes labels to the one dimensional probability distributions.

- In the introduction it is stated that previous works do not elaborate on cosmic variance, but in general they do, to some degree
 (for instance, Guaita et al., 2010).

- S2.1: is this equivalent width limit in rest-frame?

- Last paragraph 2.3: rephrase first sentence "we note by the paper M"
